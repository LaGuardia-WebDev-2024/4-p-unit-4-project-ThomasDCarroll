  <div class="section debrief lists">
    <h2>Debrief</h2>
    <p><em>Life is Strange</em> truly cemented itself as one of my favorite games after I finished it, and a large part of that was the aesthetic design of the world. The many details found within the game really breathed life into Arcadia Bay, and grounded the hectic narratives of LiS. Areas such as the Blackwell dorms and Chloe's Room had so many little trinkets and clues, and I think this led to the game having so much depth. I also think the colorstory of the different locations heavily aided the narrative, and the growth of the game. Overall, the location design was amazing!<br><br>
    As always, go play the game if you havent already,and thank you so much for looking through my project!!!</p>
